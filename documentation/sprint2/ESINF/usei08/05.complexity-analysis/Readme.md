|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|

| getItemRepository()                     | O(1)                     |

| getItemNode(ID selectedOperationID, boolean rawMaterial) | O(1)  |
| getOperationNode(ID selectedOperationID) | O(1)                     |
| findParentOperation(Node node)          | O(N)                     |
| findNameOperation(ID operationID)      | O(1)                     |
| findParentItem(Node node, boolean rawMaterial, ID selectedOperationID) | O(H + N) |
| findNameItem(ID itemID)                 | O(1)                     |
| getNodeByOperationID(ID operationID)    | O(1)                     |
| getItemNameByID(ID itemID)              | O(1)                     |

#### 1. **Complexity of Repository Methods (`getItemRepository`, `getOperationRepository`)**

These methods check if the repository is already initialized and return it. The complexity is \(O(1)\) since these methods only perform initialization checks or return existing references.

#### 2. **Method `getInformations(String path)`**

This method is responsible for loading data into the production tree from a file at the given `path`. Assuming loading involves parsing the file and constructing the tree, the complexity would depend on the size of the file \(P\) (number of lines or operations/items). The worst-case complexity would be \(O(P)\), where \(P\) is the size of the file.

#### 3. **Method `getListToShow(int flag)`**

This method iterates over the list of items or operations in the repository. If it iterates over \(N\) items or operations, the complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of items or operations.

#### 4. **Method `isRawMaterial(ID selectedOperationID)`**

This method checks if the `selectedOperationID` is a raw material by accessing the map of raw materials. The map lookup is \(O(1)\) since it uses a hash map.

#### 5. **Method `getItemNode(ID selectedOperationID, boolean rawMaterial)`**

This method retrieves a node from either the raw materials or materials map. Both maps are likely hash maps, so the lookup is \(O(1)\).

#### 6. **Method `getOperationNode(ID selectedOperationID)`**

This method retrieves the operation node from the map. As with other map lookups, this is \(O(1)\).

#### 7. **Method `findParentOperation(Node node)`**

This method finds the parent operation by traversing the tree structure. The height of the tree is denoted by \(H\), and within each level, it looks through a list of nodes. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the total number of nodes at all levels.

#### 8. **Method `findNameOperation(ID operationID)`**

This method fetches the operation name by looking up the operation ID in a map. Since it uses a map, the lookup time complexity is \(O(1)\).

#### 9. **Method `findParentItem(Node node, boolean rawMaterial, ID selectedOperationID)`**

This method traverses the tree's nodes based on the height of the tree. If the height is \(H\), it will check \(H\) levels in the worst case. Within each level, it checks \(N\) nodes, so the complexity is \(O(H + N)\), where \(H\) is the tree height and \(N\) is the number of nodes at each level.

#### 10. **Method `findNameItem(ID itemID)`**

This method fetches the item name by looking up the item ID in a map. Map lookups are \(O(1)\).

#### 11. **Method `getNodeByOperationID(ID operationID)`**

This method retrieves a node from the operation node map. Map lookups are \(O(1)\).

#### 12. **Method `getItemNameByID(ID itemID)`**

This method retrieves the item name by ID, again performing a map lookup. The complexity is \(O(1)\).

### **Overall Complexity Analysis**

The overall complexity of the `ProductionTreeController` depends on the operations being performed. For most methods, the complexity is \(O(1)\), due to efficient data structures like hash maps used for lookups. However, methods like `getInformations` and `findParentOperation` may involve traversing larger datasets, leading to higher complexity.

For methods that traverse the production tree or work with lists (such as `getListToShow` and `findParentOperation`), the overall complexity can be \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of items, operations, or nodes being processed.

Thus, the overall complexity is roughly dominated by methods that deal with the tree structure or large lists:

\[
O(N) \quad \text{(for most list-based operations and tree traversals)}
\]

| Method                                   | Complexity                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| ProductionTree()                         | O(1)                      |
| getItemRepository()                      | O(1)                      |
| getInformations(String path)             | O(n * m)                  |
| associatedQtdToItem(ID itemID, float qtd) | O(1)                      |
| fillTreeHeight(Node node, int height)    | O(n)                      |
| findNodeByOperation(ID id)              | O(n)                      |
| setPdtTreeName(String pdtTreeName)       | O(1)                      |
| getNodesOfTree()                         | O(1)                      |
| getHeightMap()                           | O(1)                      |
| getOperationNodeID()                    | O(1)                      |
| getMaterials()                           | O(1)                      |
| getRawMaterials()                        | O(1)                      |
| getTotalRequiredMaterials()              | O(n)                      |

#### 1. **Constructor (`ProductionTree()`)**

The constructor initializes several data structures (e.g., `heightMap`, `nodesOfTree`, `materials`, `rawMaterials`, `operationNodeID`) and calls `getItemRepository()`. This initialization is done in constant time, so the complexity is:

\[
O(1)
\]

#### 2. **Method `getItemRepository()`**

This method checks if the `ItemRepository` is initialized. If not, it initializes it by accessing the `Repositories` singleton. This involves a single conditional check and map access, making the complexity:

\[
O(1)
\]

#### 3. **Method `getInformations(String path)`**

This method reads information from a file, processes it, and constructs nodes. The complexity depends on the number of records (`n`) and the number of operations/materials per record (`m`). The method iterates over `n` records, and for each record, it processes operations and materials, which adds a factor of `m`. Therefore, the time complexity of this method is:

\[
O(n * m)
\]

where `n` is the number of records, and `m` is the average number of operations/materials per record.

#### 4. **Method `associatedQtdToItem(ID itemID, float qtd)`**

This method updates the quantity of an item in the `ItemRepository`. Since it accesses a map with a constant-time lookup, the complexity is:

\[
O(1)
\]

#### 5. **Method `fillTreeHeight(Node node, int height)`**

This method recursively calculates the height of each node in the tree. The complexity depends on the number of nodes in the tree (`n`), as it processes each node exactly once. The worst-case complexity is:

\[
O(n)
\]

where `n` is the number of nodes.

#### 6. **Method `findNodeByOperation(ID id)`**

This method searches through the `nodesOfTree` list to find a node corresponding to the given operation ID. In the worst case, it checks each node, resulting in a linear search. Therefore, the complexity is:

\[
O(n)
\]

where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

#### 7. **Method `setPdtTreeName(String pdtTreeName)`**

This method sets the name of the production tree. Since it involves a simple field assignment, the complexity is:

\[
O(1)
\]

#### 8. **Getter Methods (`getNodesOfTree()`, `getHeightMap()`, `getOperationNodeID()`, `getMaterials()`, `getRawMaterials()`)**

All these getter methods return simple references to fields. Since no iteration or complex operations are involved, the complexity for each of these methods is:

\[
O(1)
\]

#### 9. **Method `getTotalRequiredMaterials()`**

This method calculates the total quantity of required materials for production. It first calls `getInformations()`, which has a complexity of \(O(n * m)\), and then iterates through the `rawMaterials` map (which has a size of `n`). The complexity of iterating through the raw materials is \(O(n)\), and each operation within the loop is \(O(1)\), making the overall complexity of `getTotalRequiredMaterials()`:

\[
O(n * m + n)
\]

Since \(O(n * m)\) dominates \(O(n)\), the final complexity is:

\[
O(n * m)
\]

### **Overall Complexity**

The overall complexity of the `ProductionTree` class is primarily driven by the methods that process the information file (`getInformations()`) and the method that calculates the required materials (`getTotalRequiredMaterials()`). The overall complexity of these operations is \(O(n * m)\), where `n` is the number of records and `m` is the average number of operations/materials per record.

Therefore, the overall complexity of the `ProductionTree` class is:

\[
O(n * m)
\]

where `n` is the number of records in the file and `m` is the average number of operations/materials per record.



Hereâ€™s a similar complexity analysis for the `Node` class:

### **Node Class: Complexity Analysis**

| Method                                                   | Complexity |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Node(ID operationID, ID itemID, float itemQuantity, Map<ID, Float> operationMap, Map<ID, Float> materialMap) | O(1)       |
| getOperationID()                                         | O(1)       |
| getItemID()                                              | O(1)       |
| getItemQuantity()                                        | O(1)       |
| getOperationMap()                                        | O(1)       |
| getMaterialMap()                                         | O(1)       |
| getItemQuantityByID(ID id)                               | O(1)       |
| setOperationMap(Map<ID, Float> operationMap)             | O(1)       |
| setMaterialMap(Map<ID, Float> materialMap)               | O(1)       |
| setHeightInTree(int heightInTree)                        | O(1)       |
| getHeightInTree()                                        | O(1)       |
| toString()                                               | O(n + m)   |

### 1. Method `Node`

- The constructor of the `Node` class initializes various attributes of the object, such as `operationID`, `itemID`, `itemQuantity`, `operationMap`, `materialMap`, and `heightInTree`. All these operations are simple assignments or initializations, so the complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 2. Method `getOperationID`

- This method returns the `operationID` field, which is a simple field access operation. The complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 3. Method `getItemID`

- This method returns the `itemID` field, which is another simple field access operation, resulting in \(O(1)\) complexity.

### 4. Method `getItemQuantity`

- This method returns the `itemQuantity` field, which is a constant-time operation. The complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 5. Method `getOperationMap`

- This method returns the `operationMap` field, which is a simple field access operation. The complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 6. Method `getMaterialMap`

- This method returns the `materialMap` field, which is also a simple field access operation. The complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 7. Method `getItemQuantityByID`

- This method performs a lookup on the `materialMap` to retrieve the quantity associated with the provided ID. Since lookups in a hash map are constant time, the complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 8. Method `setOperationMap`

- This method sets the `operationMap` field to a new value. It is a simple assignment operation, so the complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 9. Method `setMaterialMap`

- This method sets the `materialMap` field to a new value. This is a simple assignment operation, so the complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 10. Method `setHeightInTree`

- This method sets the `heightInTree` field to a new value. It is a simple assignment, resulting in \(O(1)\) complexity.

### 11. Method `getHeightInTree`

- This method returns the `heightInTree` field, which is a simple field access operation. The complexity is \(O(1)\).

### 12. Method `toString`

- The `toString` method constructs a string representation of the `Node` object. It iterates over the `operationMap` and `materialMap` to append the values to the string. The complexity of this operation depends on the sizes of the maps, resulting in \(O(n + m)\), where `n` is the size of the `operationMap` and `m` is the size of the `materialMap`.

### Overall Complexity

Overall, the complexity of most methods in the `Node` class is \(O(1)\), meaning they operate in constant time. The only exception is the `toString` method, which has a complexity of \(O(n + m)\) due to the iteration over the maps. This indicates that the `Node` class is efficient in its operations for most methods, with the exception of string representation, which depends on the size of the data stored in the maps.

Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!



### **Overall Complexity Analysis for Production Tree System**

To summarize the overall complexity of the entire production tree system, we need to consider the various components: `ProductionTreeController`, `ProductionTree`, and `Node` classes. Below is a breakdown of the main factors affecting the complexity:

#### **1. `ProductionTreeController`**

- Most methods in `ProductionTreeController` have **constant time complexity** (\(O(1)\)), particularly those that involve direct lookups or simple assignments, such as `getItemRepository`, `getOperationRepository`, `setName`, `getListToShow`, etc.
- The more computationally expensive methods include:
    - `getInformations(String path)`: This method has a complexity of \(O(P)\), where \(P\) is the number of operations/items in the input data file.
    - `findParentOperation(Node node)`: This method traverses the production tree and has a worst-case complexity of \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
    - `findParentItem(Node node, boolean rawMaterial, ID selectedOperationID)`: The complexity of this method is \(O(H + N)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree and \(N\) is the number of nodes at each level.

Thus, the overall complexity of `ProductionTreeController` is dominated by tree traversal and data loading methods, primarily:

\[
O(N) \quad \text{(tree traversal, list-based operations)}
\]
and
\[
O(P) \quad \text{(loading data into the tree)}
\]

#### **2. `ProductionTree`**

- Most methods in `ProductionTree` have **constant time complexity** (\(O(1)\)), such as `getItemRepository`, `getMaterials`, `getRawMaterials`, etc.
- The method `getInformations(String path)` has a complexity of \(O(n * m)\), where:
    - `n` is the number of records,
    - `m` is the average number of operations/materials per record.
- Methods like `fillTreeHeight(Node node, int height)` and `findNodeByOperation(ID id)` both have complexities of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.

The overall complexity of `ProductionTree` is:

\[
O(n * m) \quad \text{(for data loading and processing)}
\]
and
\[
O(n) \quad \text{(for tree traversal and finding nodes)}
\]

#### **3. `Node` Class**

- The complexity of most methods in the `Node` class is **constant time** (\(O(1)\)), such as methods for accessing fields (`getOperationID`, `getItemID`, etc.) or setting values (`setOperationMap`, `setMaterialMap`, etc.).
- The only method with non-constant complexity is `toString`, which depends on the size of the `operationMap` and `materialMap`. The complexity of this method is \(O(n + m)\), where `n` is the size of the `operationMap` and `m` is the size of the `materialMap`.

Thus, the overall complexity of `Node` is:

\[
O(1) \quad \text{(for most methods)}
\]
and
\[
O(n + m) \quad \text{(for the `toString` method)}
\]

---

### **Final Overall Complexity**

The overall complexity of the entire system is dominated by the methods in `ProductionTreeController` and `ProductionTree` that process large datasets and traverse trees. Based on the individual complexities of the classes:

- For **data loading** (`getInformations` and similar methods), the complexity is \(O(n * m)\).
- For **tree traversal and node searches** (`findParentOperation`, `fillTreeHeight`, etc.), the complexity is \(O(N)\).

Thus, the final overall complexity for the system is:

\[
O(n * m + N)
\]

Where:
- \(n\) is the number of records or items,
- \(m\) is the average number of operations/materials per record,
- \(N\) is the total number of nodes in the production tree.

This reflects the combined complexity of loading data, processing the tree structure, and handling operations/materials within the system.
