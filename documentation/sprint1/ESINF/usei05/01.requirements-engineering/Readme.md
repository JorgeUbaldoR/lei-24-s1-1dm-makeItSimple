### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The Simulator must fully ready so the stats can be created.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

* There is a dependency on "USEI02 - Implement a simulator that processes all the items according" once we have to simulate the work of all workstations to show all the info.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Output Data:**

* List (in ascending order) of total time of operation, and percentages relative to the operation time and total execution time.
* (In)Success of the operation
