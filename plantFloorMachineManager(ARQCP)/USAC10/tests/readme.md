### **Test Setup and Teardown**
- **`setUp`**: This function is defined but empty because no specific initialization is required before each test case in this context.
- **`tearDown`**: Similarly, this function is empty as no specific cleanup is necessary after each test case.

### **Test Cases**
Each test case evaluates the `median` function under different conditions to ensure it behaves correctly across a variety of input scenarios:

1. **`test_median_even_length`**:
   - **Description**: Tests the case where the array has an even number of elements: `[3, 1, 2, 4]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `2`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
   - **Explanation**: Since the array has an even number of elements, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements (1 and 2).

2. **`test_median_even_length_2`**:
   - **Description**: Tests another even-length array: `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `25`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
   - **Explanation**: The middle elements are 20 and 30, and the median is their average (25).

3. **`test_median_odd_length`**:
   - **Description**: Tests an odd-length array: `[3, 1, 2]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `2`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
   - **Explanation**: The median is the middle element in the sorted array, which is `2`.

4. **`test_median_odd_length_2`**:
   - **Description**: Tests another odd-length array: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `3`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
   - **Explanation**: After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]`, and the middle element is `3`.

5. **`test_median_equal_elements`**:
   - **Description**: Tests an array where all elements are equal: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `5`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
   - **Explanation**: Since all elements are the same, the median is equal to any of the elements.

6. **`test_median_length_zero`**:
   - **Description**: Tests the case where the array has zero elements: `[]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `0`, and the result should be `0` indicating no data available.
   - **Explanation**: An empty array has no median, so the function returns `0` to indicate no data.

7. **`test_median_negative_elements_odd`**:
   - **Description**: Tests an odd-length array with negative elements: `[-10, -20, -30, -40, -50]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `-30`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
   - **Explanation**: After sorting, the array becomes `[-50, -40, -30, -20, -10]`, and the median is the middle element, `-30`.

8. **`test_median_negative_elements_even`**:
   - **Description**: Tests an even-length array with negative elements: `[-10, -20, -30, -40, -50, -60]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `-35`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
   - **Explanation**: After sorting, the array becomes `[-60, -50, -40, -30, -20, -10]`. The median is the average of the two middle elements, `-40` and `-30`, resulting in `-35`.

9. **`test_median_mix_elements_odd`**:
   - **Description**: Tests an odd-length array with mixed positive and negative elements: `[-3, 2, -1, 4, 1, 2]`.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `1`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
   - **Explanation**: After sorting, the array becomes `[-3, -1, 1, 2, 2, 4]`. The median is the average of the two middle elements, `1` and `2`, resulting in `1`.

10. **`test_median_mix_elements_odd_2`**:
    - **Description**: Tests another mixed array: `[-3, 2, -1, 4, 1, -2]`.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `0`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
    - **Explanation**: After sorting, the array becomes `[-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 4]`. The median is the average of the two middle elements, `-1` and `1`, resulting in `0`.

11. **`test_median_negative_length`**:
    - **Description**: Tests an array with a negative length: `[1, 2]` and length `-1`.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `0`, and the result should be `0` indicating failure due to invalid input.
    - **Explanation**: A negative length is not valid, so the function returns `0` to indicate failure.

12. **`test_median_length_one`**:
    - **Description**: Tests an array with a single element: `[1]`.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `1`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
    - **Explanation**: An array with a single element has that element as the median.

13. **`test_median_null_vec`**:
    - **Description**: Tests an array of zero elements represented by `NULL`: `[0, 0, 0]` (note: corrected to be non-NULL array of zeros).
    - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `0`, and the function should return `1` indicating success.
    - **Explanation**: The function processes the array of zeros correctly and returns `0` as the median.

14. **`test_median_null_vec_2`**:
    - **Description**: Tests a `NULL` pointer as the input array (`int* vec = NULL`).
    - **Expected Outcome**: The median should be `0`, and the function should return `0` indicating failure due to invalid input.
    - **Explanation**: The function should return `0` for both the median and result, as the input array is invalid.

### **Main Function**
- **Description**: The main function initializes the Unity test framework, runs all defined test cases, and concludes the testing session with the results.
- **Flow**: The test results will indicate whether the `median` function passes all these conditions, providing feedback on its correctness.

### **Key Assumptions**
- The `median` function is assumed to return `1` for success and `0` for failure.
- The function correctly handles various edge cases, such as empty arrays, negative values, arrays with all equal elements, and invalid lengths or `NULL` pointers.
- The function correctly calculates the median by sorting the array and identifying the middle element(s), whether the array length is odd or even.
