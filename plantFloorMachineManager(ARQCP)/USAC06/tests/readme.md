### **Test Setup and Teardown**

- **`setUp`**: This function is defined but empty because no specific initialization is required before each test case
  in this context.
- **`tearDown`**: Similarly, this function is empty as no specific cleanup is necessary after each test case.

### **Test Cases**

Each test case evaluates the `dequeue_value` function under different conditions to ensure it behaves correctly across a
variety of input scenarios:

1. **`test_One`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the case where the buffer has no valid values to dequeue.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 0 (failure) because no values are in the buffer to dequeue.
    - **Explanation**: The buffer is empty (no valid data to dequeue), so the dequeue operation should fail.

2. **`test_Zero`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the case where there is a valid value at the front of the buffer.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 1 (success), and the value 6 should be dequeued from the buffer.
    - **Explanation**: Since the read pointer points to a valid value in the buffer (6), it should be dequeued and returned successfully.

3. **`test_Three`**:
    - **Description**: Tests a scenario where the read pointer is at the end of the buffer, and no valid value can be dequeued.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 0 (failure) because the read pointer points to an empty slot.
    - **Explanation**: The read pointer is positioned at the end of the buffer, and no valid value can be dequeued, resulting in a failure.

4. **`test_Five`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the scenario where there is a valid value to dequeue, and the buffer has more items.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 1 (success), and the value 6 should be dequeued from the buffer.
    - **Explanation**: The read pointer is at the start of the buffer and points to a valid value (6), which should be dequeued and returned.


### **Main Function**

- **Description**: The main function initializes the Unity test framework, runs all defined test cases, and concludes
  the testing session with the results.
- **Flow**: The test results will indicate whether the `dequeue_value` function passes all these conditions, providing
  feedback on its correctness.

### **Key Assumptions**

- The dequeue_value function simulates a circular buffer and returns:
   - 1 for successful dequeue (i.e., when a valid value is dequeued).
   -	0 if the buffer is empty or if there is no valid value to dequeue at the current read pointer.
- The buffer is modeled with a read pointer and a write pointer, and the function behaves according to these pointersâ€™ positions.
- The function should correctly handle edge cases like empty buffers, full buffers, and wrap-around behavior.
