### **Test Setup and Teardown**

- **`setUp`**: This function is defined but empty because no specific initialization is required before each test case
  in this context.
- **`tearDown`**: Similarly, this function is empty as no specific cleanup is necessary after each test case.

### **Test Cases**

Each test case evaluates the `get_element` function under different conditions to ensure it behaves correctly across a
variety of input scenarios:

1. **`test_full_buffer_v1`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the function when the buffer is completely filled, starting at the head (0) and ending at the tail (23).
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 24, correctly counting all elements in the circular buffer.
    - **Explanation**: The logic should account for wrapping and correctly sum all buffer elements.

2. **`test_full_buffer_v2`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the function when the buffer is full but the head index is greater than the tail index (circular buffer wrap-around).
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 24, correctly counting all elements in the circular buffer.
    - **Explanation**: The logic should account for wrapping and correctly sum all buffer elements.

3. **`test_empty_buffer`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the function when head and tail are the same, making the buffer logically empty.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 0, as there are no elements to count.
    - **Explanation**: When head == tail, the buffer is empty regardless of its size.

4. **`test_not_full_buffer`**:
   - **Description**: Tests the function when the buffer contains only a few elements (not fully utilized).
   - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 3, indicating the number of valid elements between tail and head.
   - **Explanation**: The range between tail and head contains 3 elements, so the function should count correctly.

5. **`test_invalid_tail_buffer`**:
   - **Description**: Tests the function when the tail index is out of bounds (greater than or equal to the buffer size).
   - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return -1, indicating an invalid input.
   - **Explanation**: Indexes must be within valid bounds; the function should detect this error and return appropriately.

6. **`test_invalid_head_buffer`**:
   - **Description**: Tests the function when the head index is out of bounds (greater than or equal to the buffer size).
   - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return -1, indicating an invalid input.
   - **Explanation**: As with tail, an out-of-bounds head is invalid, and the function should handle it gracefully.

7. **`test_zero_length_buffer`**:
   - **Description**: Tests the function when the buffer length is zero, simulating an empty or uninitialized buffer.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 0, as there are no elements to count in a zero-length buffer.
   - **Explanation**: A zero-length buffer has no valid range to calculate elements, so the function should return 0 directly.

8. **`test_single_element_buffer`**:
   - **Description**: Tests the function with a single-element buffer where head and tail are at the same position.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 1, indicating one valid element in the buffer.
   - **Explanation**: A single-element buffer should correctly report the presence of exactly one item.

9. **`test_negative_head_tail`**:
   - **Description**: Tests the function with negative values for head and tail.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return -1, indicating invalid indexes.
   - **Explanation**:  Negative indexes are invalid, and the function should reject these inputs and return an error.



### **Main Function**

- **Description**: The main function initializes the Unity test framework, runs all defined test cases, and concludes
  the testing session with the results.
- **Flow**: The test results will indicate whether the `get_element` function passes all these conditions, providing
  feedback on its correctness.

### **Key Assumptions**

- The `get_element` function is assumed to return the number of elements in the buffer for success and `-1` for failure.
- The function correctly handles various edge cases, such as empty arrays, negative values for head and tail, circular wrapping scenarios, and out-of-bounds indexes, ensuring robust and reliable performance across diverse input conditions.
