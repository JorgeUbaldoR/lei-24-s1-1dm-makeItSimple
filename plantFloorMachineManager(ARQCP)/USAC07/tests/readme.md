### **Test Setup and Teardown**

- **`setUp`**: This function is defined but empty because no specific initialization is required before each test case
  in this context.
- **`tearDown`**: Similarly, this function is empty as no specific cleanup is necessary after each test case.

### **Test Cases**

Each test case evaluates the `get_n_element` function under different conditions to ensure it behaves correctly across a
variety of input scenarios:

1. **`test_Null`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the case where the function receives NULL as input for the array.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 0, indicating failure since the array is NULL.
    - **Explanation**: If the array is NULL, the function cannot proceed, and the result should be a failure (0).

2. **`test_One`**: 
    - **Description**: Tests a case where there is one element in the buffer, and the read and write pointers are at positions 0 and 1 respectively.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 1, indicating that there is one element.
    - **Explanation**: In this case, the read pointer starts at 0 and the write pointer is at 1, indicating one element is available.

3. **`test_Zero`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the case where the read and write pointers are the same, i.e., no elements to dequeue.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 0, indicating that there are no elements in the buffer.
    - **Explanation**: When both the read and write pointers are at the same position, it indicates an empty buffer, so the result should be 0.

4. **`test_Three`**:
    - **Description**: Tests the scenario where the buffer has elements, and the read and write pointers are at different positions.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 3, indicating that there are 3 elements in the buffer.
    - **Explanation**: The difference between the read and write pointers will indicate the number of elements available in the buffer.

5. **`test_Four`**:
    - **Description**: Tests a larger buffer where the read and write pointers indicate a significant difference in positions.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 100, indicating that there are 100 elements in the buffer.
    - **Explanation**: The buffer has enough space, and the positions of the read and write pointers should reflect this.

6. **`test_Five`**:
    - **Description**: Another test with a large buffer where the read and write pointers are at different positions.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The function should return 400, indicating that there are 400 elements in the buffer.
    - **Explanation**: The difference between the read and write pointers reflects the number of elements in the buffer.

### **Main Function**

- **Description**: The main function initializes the Unity test framework, runs all defined test cases, and concludes
  the testing session with the results.
- **Flow**: The test results will indicate whether the `get_n_element` function passes all these conditions, providing
  feedback on its correctness.

### **Key Assumptions**

- The `get_n_element` function is assumed to return the number of elements in the buffer for success and `-1` for
  failure.
- The function correctly handles various edge cases, such as empty arrays, negative values for head and tail, circular
  wrapping scenarios, and out-of-bounds indexes, ensuring robust and reliable performance across diverse input
  conditions.
